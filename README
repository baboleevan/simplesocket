A Simple Socket Client for PHP 5.2+
===================================

This library contains one class, SimpleSocketClient, that implements a generic
socket client. You can inherit this class to write client libraries for any
modern text-based protocol.

Fully featured client libraries for Memcached and Redis are bundled as examples.

Features:

  * Socket creation, reading, and writing (of course).
  * Lazy loading : will not connect until actually needed.
  * Automatically deal with end-of-line CRLF sequences.
  * Basic key validation and command building helper methods.

Public Methods:

  * __construct($host, $port, $timeout = 5)
  * connect()
  * disconnect()

Protected Methods:

  * read($bytes, $autonewline = true, $trim = true)
  * readline($trim = true)
  * write($string, $autonewline = true)
  * validate_key($key)
  * build_command()
